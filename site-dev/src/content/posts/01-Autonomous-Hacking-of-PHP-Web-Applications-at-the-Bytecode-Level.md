## Introduction

Itâ€™s 5th June 2022, after hacking on PHP's Virtual Machine, I chose to experiment with an algorithm of my creation called the `follow-back algorithm`, aimed at automatically detecting vulnerabilities in the PHP codebase at the bytecode level.

Following the research, I chose to assess it against the vulnerable web applications listed below. These applications are specifically designed for security professionals to enhance their skills and test their tools in a legal environment, serving as my test cases.

## Common PHP Vulnerabilities

Before we delve into how the `follow-back algorithm` works. Let's take a look at a few common PHP vulnerabilities. Most common PHP vulnerabilities get user input using global variables like `$_REQUEST`, `$_POST`, and `$_GET` and are later used in potentially vulnerable functions, generating SQL strings, echoing/printing back data to the user, etc. Example codes are below:  

*Generating SQL Queries*
```php
$sql = 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employeeId = ' . $_GET['data'] . $_GET['id'];
```

*Combining with other strings*
```php
$user = 'User: ' . $_GET['name'];
echo $user
```

*Printing/Echoing out some data back to the user*
```php
echo "$_GET['p']";
```

*Include pages from user-supplied input*
```php
include $_GET['page'];
```

---

## Common Static Analyzers (REGEX Search, AST Pattern-based Search)
With the example codes above, vulnerabilities can be easily found using most static analyzers which are based on either [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) pattern search or using [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) search.  
But gets tricky or incorrect if user-supplied inputs (`$_REQUEST`, `$_POST`, `$_GET`) aren't directly used but travel across the different parts of the code before being used in potentially vulnerable functions like the examples below:  

*Example (1) code where AST pattern search analysis fails*
```php
$uname = $_POST["uname"];
$passwd = $_POST["password"];
$sql = "SELECT uname, passwd FROM users WHERE uname='$uname'";
```

*Example (2) code where AST pattern search analysis fails*
```php
$id = $_GET['id'] ?? 1;
$cusId = $id;
$anotherCusId = $cusId;
$file_db->query('SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customerId = ' . $anotherCusId)
```

AST pattern search or Regex search static analyzers fail for the example codes above because user-supplied input is not directly used but passes through other user-defined variables before it's being used which is a limitation for our analysis.  
To be able to find the above vulnerabilities, you need to be able to track how data moves across variables down to where data is used in a potentially vulnerable function.   

---

## Overcoming the limitations of static analysis based on AST or REGEX pattern search 
With the limitation of AST/REGEX pattern-based search, we need a way to track how user input data moves down to the designated sink function or instruction. This is where [data-flow analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis) comes in. 

With Data-flow Analysis, you to track user input data defined in a variable down to specific destinated sink variables or instructions.  

There are other interesting data structures like [Control Flow Graph (CFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph), Data Flow Graph (DFG), [Static single-assignment (SSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form) variables which are necessary for data-flow analysis.  

But these data structures (`CFG`, `DFG`, `SSA`) cannot be extracted from a raw AST data structure unless the AST is broken down into a simpler Intermediate Representation or Instructions.  

And PHP happens to have APIs (`zend_compile_file`) which translate PHP code/ASTs to its simpler [Three-address code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code) Zend bytecode instructions called [opcodes](https://x-team.com/blog/learn-about-php-opcodes/) and also APIs (`zend_build_cfg`, `zend_build_dfg`, `zend_dump_ssa_variable`) to compute the CFG, DFG, SSA variables information.   

This got me excited because as someone who likes to perform a lot of program analysis on code, I always look out for frameworks and libraries which lift code from Code/[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) to [IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation) along with other data structure like [Control Flow Graph (CFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph), DFG, [SSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form), etc but in this case, PHP already had everything which also means no matter how complex PHP code is written, it gets reduced to 254 `Three-address code` instructions along with program analysis features.

## PHP Bytecode Instructions

Since we working at the PHP bytecode level, we need to understand a few things about it.  
PHP bytecode instructions are called `Zend Opcodes` and are generated by the interpreter and passed to the Zend Engine for execution.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/opcode_rez.png)  

PHP bytecode is a Three-address code memory-based instruction instead of register-based or stack-based which is designed to be executed and discarded with each instruction having a numeric identifier called `OpCode` which specifies which operation to perform by the Zend Virtual Machine. More information on [PHP Opcodes](https://x-team.com/blog/learn-about-php-opcodes/).

*Example Hello World code with its Generated Opcodes below using `phpdbg`.*
```php
<?php
$var1 =  "hello";
echo $var1 . "world";
?>
```

*Generated Opcodes for the above `Hello World` code above*
```js
php@b4020519b49b:/src# phpdbg -p* test/test0.php
function name: (null)
L1-8 {main}() /src/test/test0.php - 0x7f70e0a6d300 + 4 ops

num    opcode_name             op1                  op2                  result
#0     ASSIGN                  $var1                "hello"
#1     CONCAT                  $var1                "world"              ~1
#2     ECHO                    ~1
#3     RETURN<-1>              1
```

Each instruction has an instruction index `num`, an `opcode_name` which is a string representation of its opcode number, 2 operands (`op1`, `op2`), and a return operand `result`.  

We can see 4 generated bytecode instructions (`ZEND_ASSIGN`, `ZEND_CONCAT`, `ZEND_ECHO`, `ZEND_RETURN`) with their arguments. The [list of OPCodes in PHP 7](https://php-legacy-docs.zend.com/manual/php5/en/internals2.opcodes).  

I like working at the instructions/bytecode level because it gives you granular information about how data is accurately moved in a program.

## SOURCES and SINKS instructions or variables

To test my theory, we need to define the terminologies `SOURCES` and `SINKS` for our data flow analysis. The term `SOURCES` is where user input data is supplied and `SINKS` is destinated instructions or variables where user input might end up.  

**Source Example**

`FETCH_R` instruction from the generated bytecode below fetches the global variable `"_REQUEST"` from `op1` into a temporary variable `~0` in `result` and uses `FETCH_DIM_R` to retrieve `"name"` in `op2` from temporary variable `~0` (`op1`) into temporary variable `~1` (`result`).  

```php
# User supplied Input data

$_REQUEST['name'];
```
```js
// Generated Bytecode Instructions for the above User-supplied Input data code

num    opcode_name             op1                  op2                  result
#0     FETCH_R<2>              "_REQUEST"                                ~0
#1     FETCH_DIM_R             ~0                   "name"               ~1
```

**Sink Example**

`ECHO` instruction prints out data stored in `op1` to the user. Even though in this particular example, `op1` is `"hello world"`, `op1` can also be a variable which can be a user-supplied input data.  

```php
# destinated instructions or variables where user input might end up

echo "hello world";
```
```js
// Generated Bytecode Instructions for the above-destinated sink code

num    opcode_name             op1                  op2                  result
#3     ECHO                    "hello world"
```

---

## Understanding the `follow-back` algorithm

From the given `SOURCE` and `SINK` examples above, using the generated bytecode below we want to be able to track the temporary variable `~3` in `op1` which is used in the `ECHO` instruction which is our `SINK` instruction back to `FETCH_R` and `FETCH_DIM_R` which are the `SOURCE` instructions where user input data is retrieved.  

```php
$var1 =  $_REQUEST['name'];
echo $var1 . "world";
```
```js
// Generated Bytecode Instructions below

num    opcode_name             op1                  op2                  result
#0     FETCH_R<2>              "_REQUEST"                                ~0
#1     FETCH_DIM_R             ~0                   "name"               ~1
#2     ASSIGN                  $var1                ~1
#3     CONCAT                  $var1                "world"              ~3
#4     ECHO                    ~3
```

Once the sources and sinks are identified in our instructions, the next step involves extracting all variable arguments used at the potential sink instruction.  
Afterwards, repeat the steps below until the current instruction is the source instruction that uses user-defined input.  

1 - find out the instructions where these variables are defined using PHP's Data-flow SSA APIs and set the current instruction to where these variables are defined  
2 - retrieve all variable arguments (excluding constants arguments) used in the current instruction  
3 - repeat step `1` if the current instruction isn't our source instruction that uses user-defined input.  


<!-- We find out the location or instruction where these variables are defined using PHP's Data-flow SSA APIs and set the current instruction to where these variables are defined and retrieve all variable arguments (excluding constants arguments) used in the current instruction, and iterate through this process until we reach the source instruction that uses user-defined input. -->

### Manual walkthrough

Let's manually walk through the `follow-back` algorithm using the simple vulnerable code below which gets user input from `$_REQUEST['name']`, stores the data in `$var1` and prints it back to the user using `echo`.  

```php
$var1 =  $_REQUEST['name'];
echo $var1 . "world";
```
```js
// Generated Bytecode Instructions for the vulnerable PHP code above

num    opcode_name             op1                  op2                  result
#0     FETCH_R<2>              "_REQUEST"                                ~0
#1     FETCH_DIM_R             ~0                   "name"               ~1
#2     ASSIGN                  $var1                ~1
#3     CONCAT                  $var1                "world"              ~3
#4     ECHO                    ~3
```

We start by pinpointing our `SINK` instruction, which, in this instance, is the `ECHO` instruction. The `ECHO` instruction accepts a sole argument `op1` which holds a temporary variable named `~3`, and outputs the content of `~3`.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs/001_rez.gif)  

We need to find out where the temporary variable `~3` is defined and in this case, it is defined by instruction num `#3` which is the `CONCAT` instruction.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs2/00000_rez.gif)  

Once we have where `~3` is defined, we can look for all arguments with variables used in the creation or definition of `~3`.  
The only variable used here is only `$var1` in `op1`. Even though `op2` holds data (`"world"`), it can't be used because it's a constant value and not a variable.   

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs2/00001_rez.gif)  

We now move to get where `$var1` used in the `CONCAT` instruction is defined or created.  
`$var1` is defined at instruction num `#2` which is an `ASSIGN` instruction.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs2/00002_rez.gif)  

We repeat the cycle by retrieving all arguments with variables used in the creation or definition of `$var1`.  
The only variable used here is the temporary variable `~1` in `op2`.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs2/00003_rez.gif)  

We still repeat the cycle by getting where temporary variable `~1` is defined which is instruction num `#1` which is a `FETCH_DIM_R` instruction.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs2/00004_rez.gif)  

So again we can retrieve variable arguments used in the definition of `~1`.  
The only variable used here is the temporary variable `~0` in `op1` because even though `op2` holds a data value `"name"`, it cannot be utilized as it represents a constant rather than a variable.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs2/00005_rez.gif) 

the cycle is then repeated to find where temporary variable `~0` in `op1` is defined, which is instruction num `#0`, a `FETCH_R<2>` instruction.  

![follow-back algorithm](/images/gifs2/00006_rez.gif) 

While repeating the cycle, we need to constantly check if we have arrived at our `SOURCE` input or instruction `(FETCH_DIM_R, FETCH_R)` and from the walk-through, we have arrived at the `SOURCE` input.  

After accurately tracing back from a potential `SINK` to the input `SOURCE`, we can now retrieve the source code lines from all the recorded instructions along the paths and manually validate the Vulnerability.

## Limitation of Follow-back Algorithm
Some variables are defined from function calls and the functions could be validators. This can be resolved by adding logic to record and check variables defined from function call instructions.  

Also, some variables are passed as arguments to function calls which could return a new variable from the function return. This can also be resolved by adding logic to check if a variable is passed to a function call returns a newly created/defined variable.  

This currently only works for PHP codebase which uses global variables (`$_REQUEST`, `$_POST`, `$_GET`) directly in all files but can be modified to use specific input instructions.  

Other limitations are inconsistencies in DFG data structure from PHP probably due to incomplete code.
